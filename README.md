# Silage Depot
This was my first ever mod created from scratch for Farming Simulator 22, and was submitted to GIANTS Software for inclusion to the ModHub, but was denied because it re-uses basegame assets (and someone else already released a similar building using the same asset), even though those basegame assets were re-textured.

The Silage Depot is designed to process Silage from Grass, Hay, and Chaff. There are two sizes available, and the amount of production capacity, storage and speed are relative to the size of the building placed. 

## Description from the ModDesc:
> Multiple silage production depots to convert grass, hay &amp; chaff into Silage.
> RECIPES:
> - Grass Silage: 500L GRASS -> 500L SILAGE, 50L DIGESTATE
> - Hay Silage: 500L HAY -> 500L SILAGE, 50L DIGESTATE
> - Chaff Silage: 500L CHAFF -> 500L SILAGE, 50L DIGESTATE
